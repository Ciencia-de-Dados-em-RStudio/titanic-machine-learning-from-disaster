#Lists
#Lists in Python represent ordered sequences of values. Here is an example of how to create them:
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]

#We can put other types of things in lists
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
#We can even make a list of lists:

hands = [
    ['J', 'Q', 'K'],
    ['2', '2', '2'],
    ['6', 'A', 'K'], # (Comma after the last element is optional)
]
# (I could also have written this on one line, but it can get hard to read)
hands = [['J', 'Q', 'K'], ['2', '2', '2'], ['6', 'A', 'K']]

#A list can contain a mix of different types of variables:
my_favourite_things = [32, 'raindrops on roses', help]
# (Yes, Python's help function is *definitely* one of my favourite things)

#Indexing
#You can access individual list elements with square brackets.
#Which planet is closest to the sun? Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element has index 0.

planets[0]
#'Mercury'

#What's the next closest planet?
planets[1]
#'Venus'

#Which planet is furthest from the sun?
#Elements at the end of the list can be accessed with negative numbers, starting from -1:
planets[-1]
#'Neptune'
planets[-2]
#'Uranus'

#Slicing
#What are the first three planets? We can answer this question using slicing:
planets[0:3]
#['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
#planets[0:3] is our way of asking for the elements of planets starting from index 0 and continuing up to but not including index 3.

#The starting and ending indices are both optional. 
#If I leave out the start index, it's assumed to be 0. So I could rewrite the expression above as:
planets[:3]
#['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']
#If I leave out the end index, it's assumed to be the length of the list.
planets[3:]
#['Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
#i.e. the expression above means "give me all the planets from index 3 onward".

#We can also use negative indices when slicing:
# All the planets except the first and last
planets[1:-1]
#['Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus']
# The last 3 planets
planets[-3:]
#['Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']

#Changing lists
#Lists are "mutable", meaning they can be modified "in place".

#One way to modify a list is to assign to an index or slice expression.

#For example, let's say we want to rename Mars:

planets[3] = 'Malacandra'
planets
#['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Malacandra', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']

#Hm, that's quite a mouthful. Let's compensate by shortening the names of the first 3 planets.
planets[:3] = ['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur']
print(planets)
#['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur', 'Malacandra', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
# That was silly. Let's give them back their old names
planets[:4] = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars',]
print(planets)
#['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']

#List functions
#Python has several useful functions for working with lists.
#len gives the length of a list:
# How many planets are there?
len(planets)
#8
#sorted returns a sorted version of a list:
# The planets sorted in alphabetical order
sorted(planets)
#['Earth', 'Jupiter', 'Mars', 'Mercury', 'Neptune', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Venus']
#sum does what you might expect:
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
sum(primes)
#17
%We've previously used the min and max to get the minimum or maximum of several arguments.
#But we can also pass in a single list argument.
max(primes)
#7

#Interlude: objects
#I've used the term 'object' a lot so far - you may have even read that everything in Python is an object. What does that mean?
#In short, objects carry some things around with them. 
#You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.
#For example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called imag representing their imaginary part. 
#(You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)
x = 12
# x is a real number, so its imaginary part is 0.
print(x.imag)
#0
# Here's how to make a complex number, in case you've ever been curious:
c = 12 + 3j
print(c.imag)
#3.0
#The things an object carries around can also include functions. 
#A function attached to an object is called a method. 
#(Non-function things attached to an object, such as imag, are called attributes).
#For example, numbers have a method called bit_length. 
#Again, we access it using dot syntax:
x.bit_length
#<built-in method bit_length of int object at 0x10e297b50>
#To actually call it, we add parentheses:
x.bit_length()
#4
#Aside: You've actually been calling methods already if you've been doing the exercises. 
#In the exercise notebooks q1, q2, q3, etc. are all objects which have methods called check, hint, and solution.
#In the same way that we can pass functions to the help function (e.g. help(max)), we can also pass in methods:
#help(x.bit_length)
# this command causes error in R and reticulate() -> help function!!

#The examples above were utterly obscure. None of the types of objects we've looked at so far (numbers, functions, booleans) have attributes or methods you're likely ever to use.
#But it turns out that lists have several methods which you'll use all the time.
#List methods
#list.append modifies a list by adding an item to the end:

# Pluto is a planet darn it!
planets.append('Pluto')

#Why does the cell above have no output? Let's check the documentation by calling help(planets.append).
#Aside: append is a method carried around by all objects of type list, not just planets, so we also could have called help(list.append). 
#However, if we try to call help(append), Python will complain that no variable exists called "append". 
#The "append" name only exists within lists - it doesn't exist as a standalone name like builtin functions such as max or len.

#help(planets.append)

#The -> None part is telling us that list.append doesn't return anything.
#But if we check the value of planets, we can see that the method call modified the value of planets:
planets

#list.pop removes and returns the last element of a list:

planets.pop()
#'Pluto'
planets
#['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']

#Searching lists
#Where does Earth fall in the order of planets? We can get its index using the list.index method.

planets.index('Earth')
#2
#It comes third (i.e. at index 2 - 0 indexing!).
#At what index does Pluto occur?
planets.index('Pluto')
#ValueError: 'Pluto' is not in list

$Oh, that's right...
#To avoid unpleasant surprises like this, we can use the in operator to determine whether a list contains a particular value:

# Is Earth a planet?
"Earth" in planets
#True

## Is Calbefraques a planet?
"Calbefraques" in planets
#False

#There are a few more interesting list methods we haven't covered.
#If you want to learn about all the methods and attributes attached to a particular object, we can call help() on the object itself.
#For example, help(planets) will tell us about all the list methods:
help(planets)


#Click the "output" button to see the full help page. 
#Lists have lots of methods with weird-looking names like __eq__ and __iadd__. Don't worry too much about these for now. 
#(You'll probably never call such methods directly. 
#But they get called behind the scenes when we use syntax like indexing or comparison operators.)
#The most interesting methods are toward the bottom of the list (append, clear, copy, etc.).

#Tuples
#Tuples are almost exactly the same as lists. They differ in just two ways.
#1: The syntax for creating them uses parentheses instead of square brackets
t = (1, 2, 3)
t = 1, 2, 3 # equivalent to above
t
#2: They cannot be modified (they are immutable).
t[0] = 100
#TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
#Tuples are often used for functions that have multiple return values.
#For example, the as_integer_ratio() method of float objects returns a numerator and a denominator in the form of a tuple:
x = 0.125
x.as_integer_ratio()
(1, 8)

#These multiple return values can be individually assigned as follows:
numerator, denominator = x.as_integer_ratio()
print(numerator / denominator)

#Finally we have some insight into the classic Stupid Python Trickâ„¢ for swapping two variables!
a = 1
b = 0
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)
#0 1
